# Project Name
    JQuery With Events

**Author**: James McDaniel/Ana Ortega

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We added functionality to a web site by creating JQuery event bindings with the $.on() method and configured the event bindings with delegation.


## Getting Started
Set up event handlers for everything that will accept user input: author filter, category filter, main nav, and read on.  
Next, write functions for each event handler that perform the desired action - usually hiding the undesired elements from the DOM and displaying the desired ones.
Finally, set the teaser function to show only the first two elements of each article, and the read-on event handler to show the rest of them.


## Architecture
This was built using JavaScript and JQuery.
